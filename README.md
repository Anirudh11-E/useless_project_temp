## 📱 Project Description  
**Tap & Traps** is a humorous and intentionally biased app that pretends to randomly select a winner between two tappers—but secretly, it always chooses the second tapper. Built just for laughs and fun during hackathons!

---

## 😜 The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
Randomness is stressful. Why leave things to chance when you can rig the result every single time?

---

## 🎉 The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
We created Tap & Traps: an app that accepts two taps and always chooses the second tapper as the winner—while looking like it's doing a fair selection.

## ⚡ Why "useless"?  
Because rigging a random result isn't just wrong—it's fun when done on purpose. Tap & Traps delivers unfair results with full transparency (and style).
